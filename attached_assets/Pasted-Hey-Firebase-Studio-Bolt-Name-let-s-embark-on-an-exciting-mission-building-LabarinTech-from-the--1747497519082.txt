Hey [Firebase Studio/Bolt Name], let's embark on an exciting mission: building LabarinTech from the ground up!
Project Vision & Vibe:
Our core goal is to create the leading online tech magazine and news platform for Northern Nigeria, and eventually, the world. LabarinTech (meaning 'Story of Technology') needs to deliver insightful recommendations, engaging, practical content based on products, and super current news. The overall vibe should be modern, clean, vibrant, accessible, and inspiring, reflecting the innovation happening in the region. We're building for a diverse audience: Aisha, the aspiring young developer; Ibrahim, the mid-career tech professional; and Hajara, the ambitious tech entrepreneur. The platform must resonate with their goals and tackle their pain points. Think intuitive, user-centric, and built with a passion for tech and community.
Core Functionality – Let's Vibe This Out:
1. Content Publishing & Management System (The Admin Dashboard - The Heartbeat):
* Article Creation Flow:
* We need a slick, user-friendly Rich Text Editor (think Quill, Draft.js, or Tiptap feel) with all the essential formatting: bold, italics, headings, lists, quotes, and especially code blocks. Crucially, it must support markdown input for our more technical writers.
* Media Uploads: Seamless image and video uploads directly into articles. Support common formats (JPG, PNG, GIF, MP4). Let's ensure automatic image resizing and optimization on upload to keep things speedy. Captions and alt text for images are a must for accessibility and SEO.
* Draft Nirvana: Automatic saving of drafts is non-negotiable – protect that creative flow! Bonus points for the ability to revert to previous draft versions.
* Metadata Magic:
* Title: Required, with a character limit.
* Slug/Permalink: Auto-generate from the title but make it editable for SEO perfection.
* Description: Meta description for SEO, with a character limit.
* Keywords/Tags: Comma-separated list for fine-grained topic association.
* Categories: Ability to select one or more categories (we'll define these, e.g., Programming, AI, Mobile, Hardware – make the system ready for a hierarchical structure).
* Featured Image: An option to set a prominent featured image for previews and homepage highlights.
* Author Selection: Link this to user accounts (see Roles).
* Publish Date/Time: Let's give editors the power to schedule articles for future publication.
* Preview Power: "What You See Is What You Get" – a solid preview functionality before hitting publish.
* Article Publishing Workflow – Keep it Smooth:
* User Roles & Permissions: Define clear roles:
* Author: Can create, edit their drafts, and submit for review.
* Editor: Can review, edit any draft, and approve content.
* Publisher: Can publish approved articles.
* Workflow States: Articles need states like 'Draft', 'Pending Review', 'Approved', 'Published', 'Scheduled'.
* Gentle Notifications: Email nudges for relevant users as articles transition states (e.g., author gets a ping when approved, publisher when ready to go live).
* Version Control: Track changes and allow rollbacks to previous versions of an article.
* Content Organization – Structure the Knowledge:
* Categories: Implement a system for hierarchical categories.
* Tags: Free-form tags for more granular connections.
* Featured Articles: A simple toggle to mark articles as "featured" for homepage/special section display.
* Article Listing Pages: Clean lists of articles, sortable by date, category, etc., with pagination for easy Browse.
* Related Articles: Intelligently suggest related articles (based on tags/categories) at the end of each piece to keep users engaged.
2. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX) – The Public Face:
* Homepage Vibe:
* Layout: Clean, modern, and engaging. Think a card-based or grid layout for article previews. It should showcase:
* Featured Articles Section: Prominently at the top, using high-quality images and compelling titles.
* Recent News Section: Latest articles with title, short excerpt, and publish date.
* Category Highlights: Give users a taste of diverse content.
* Newsletter Signup: A clear, inviting call to action.

* Content Display: Prominent title, author, publish date, and category. Optimize image/video display for all devices (lightbox for full-size images).
* Social Sharing: Easy-to-find social sharing buttons (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram).
* Related Articles: Display suggestions at the bottom.
* Author Bio: Short author bio at the end, potentially linking to an author profile page if we expand user accounts later.
* (Optional - Phase 2 or later): Comments Section: If we do this, keep it clean. Maybe Disqus or a custom Supabase solution.
* Navigation – Effortless Exploration:
* Menu Structure: Clear, logical, reflecting main content categories.
* Search Bar: Prominent in the header, always accessible.
* Footer: Links to About Us, Contact Us, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service.
* Overall Responsiveness – Mobile First, Always:
* Mobile-First Design: Prioritize the mobile experience. It MUST be flawless on phones.
* Adaptive Layout: Seamless adaptation to desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.
* Touch-Friendly Interface: Ensure buttons and links are easy to tap.
3. Branding & Style Guide – The Visual Identity:
* Color Palette:
* Primary: #1200FF (a strong, techy blue)
* Secondary: #00E5FF (a vibrant, energetic cyan/light blue)
* Typography: Google Font: Jost for everything – headings, body text, UI elements. Maintain consistency.
* Branding Feel: Modern, consistent, trustworthy, and forward-looking.
4. Search Functionality – Find it Fast:

* Call to Action: Clear and compelling (e.g., "Stay updated with Northern Nigeria's tech scene!").
* Confirmation: Simple success message.
* Email Service Integration:
* Integrate with a service like Mailchimp, SendGrid, or ConvertKit via API.
* Manage lists, segments, and unsubscribes through the provider.
* Double Opt-in: Highly recommended – send a confirmation email with a verification link.
* Subscription Management: Easy unsubscribe link in all emails.
* Design: Consistent with the site's branding; user-friendly form.
Tech Stack & "Vibe Coding" Philosophy:
We're building this with Firebase! Lean into its strengths:
Firestore: For our articles, users (content team initially), categories, tags. Design flexible schemas.
Firebase Authentication: For user logins (admin roles first).
Firebase Storage: For all image and video uploads.
Firebase Hosting: To get LabarinTech live.
Cloud Functions: For backend logic – notifications, complex search indexing (if Firestore's native isn't enough), API integrations.
Vibe Coding Approach:
Prioritize intuitive interfaces and smooth user flows for both admins and readers. If a feature feels clunky or over-engineered, let's simplify and make it feel natural.
Iterate quickly. Focus on a strong MVP for the core experience (publishing, reading), then layer on polish and secondary features.
Build with style and a robust foundation for future growth.
Code should be modular, understandable, and maintainable.
Let the needs of Aisha, Ibrahim, and Hajara guide the "feel" of the product.
